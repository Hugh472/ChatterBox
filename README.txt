README for ChatterBox

All source code can be imported directly from Github at https://github.com/BUCynergy/ChatterBox.
However, to allow Parse functionality, you need to download and install the Parse SDK specific to Android at https://www.parse.com/docs/downloads/ .
The instructions for how to implement the Parse SDK to Android Studio is at this link: https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#android/native/blank .
Select social, Android, new project, and all of the information is there.
If you require assistance with Parse, please email rjlader@bu.edu.
